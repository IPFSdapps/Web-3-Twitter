# Web-3-Twitter

Web 3.0 Twitter is a Full-Stack Blockchain App Using web3uikit, React, Moralis and Solidity.

## What was implemented and used
A simple smart contract that gives the option to save tweets into the polygon blockchain.
Used React and the Web3UIkit to build the frontend that has the feel of Twitter in a beautiful dark theme.
Finally used Moralis to authenticate users, store their profile data and tweets, and interact with the smart contract.
